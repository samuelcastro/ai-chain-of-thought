# LangChain ReAct Agent Implementation

## Overview

This project implements the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework for Large Language Models (LLMs), based on the research paper ["ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) by Shunyu Yao et al.

### What is ReAct?

ReAct is a novel paradigm that synergizes reasoning and acting in language models. The framework combines:

- **Reasoning**: The model's ability to generate thoughts and explanations
- **Acting**: The model's capability to take actions based on those thoughts

The process follows this pattern:

1. **Thought**: The model reasons about the current situation
2. **Action**: The model decides on an action to take
3. **Observation**: The model observes the result of the action
4. **Thought**: The model reasons about the observation and decides next steps

This creates a powerful loop of reasoning and action that leads to more reliable and explainable outcomes.
